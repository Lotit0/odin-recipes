        <li>1 (9 inch) prepared pie crust, baked</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>3 egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>
        <li>3 egg whites</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Stir butter, lemon juice, and lemon zest into thickened mixture. Allow mixture to cool, then pour into prepared pie shell.</li>
        <li>To make the meringue topping: beat egg whites in a large metal or glass mixing bowl until foamy. Add 6 tablespoons sugar, a little at a time, continuing to beat until all sugar is incorporated and whites are stiff.</li>
        <li>Spread meringue into pie shell, making sure to completely cover lemon filling.</li>
